# statR

This is the github-repository for the **statR** package - the Corporate Design Toolbox for R of the statistical office of the canton of Zurich for corporate design conforming graphics and spreadsheets. It contains:

- *generic colour palettes for any kind of data-visualization*

- *ggplot2-theme*

- *templates for saving data in CD-conforming formated xlsx-spreadsheets*

statR is a complement to the [**statRmd**](https://github.com/statistikZH/statRmd) package, which can be used to generate nicely formatted, ready-to-publish .pdf reports.
